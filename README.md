# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, we are expected to be able to learn:

- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm
